## üìë Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
Before running the project, ensure you have the following installed:
- **Python** (3.8 or higher)
- **[Docker and Docker Compose](https://www.docker.com/get-started)** (for setting up the database)
- **PostgreSQL** (if not using Docker)
- Any text editor or IDE (e.g., VS Code, PyCharm)

---


### Steps to Set Up the Project
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Shrutikadeshmukh9/Plant-Growth-Analytics-System.git
   cd Plant-Growth-Analytics-System

2. **Set Up a Virtual Environment**:
   Create and activate a virtual environment for the project:

   ```bash
   python -m venv env
   source env/bin/activate  # On Windows: .\env\Scripts\activate

3. **Install Dependencies**:
   Install all the required dependencies for the project:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt

4. **Set Up the Database Using Docker**:
   Ensure Docker is running, and then build and start the database:

   ```bash
   docker compose up --build

5. **Verify Database Setup**:
   Use the following Docker command to connect to the PostgreSQL instance:

   ```bash
   docker exec -it plants_db psql -U postgres -d plants
   ```

   - **View the Database**:
     After connecting to the database, you can run the following commands in the `psql` shell:

     - **List all tables**:
       ```sql
       \dt
       ```

     - **View the schema of the `plant_readings` table**:
       ```sql
       \d+ plant_readings
       ```

## üìù Task 1: Database Setup and Optimization

### üîç Analysis of the Database Schema

The provided schema for the `plant_readings` table was examined to ensure it aligns with best practices and meets the requirements of a plant monitoring system. Below are the observations and analysis:
 
1. **Existing Schema:**
   - The `plant_readings` table contains the following fields:
     - `id`: A unique identifier for each reading.
     - `zone_id`: Represents the zone where the plant is located.
     - `plant_id`: A unique identifier for each plant.
     - `temperature`, `humidity`, `soil_moisture`, and `light_level`: Sensor readings.
     - `timestamp`: The time when the reading was recorded.
2. **Analysis Plan:**
   - Data Accuracy and Redundancy:
     - Why Relevant?
       - Duplicate or inaccurate data can skew growth insights and analytics like optimal conditions or yield predictions.
     - Query for Redundancy:
       ```bash
       SELECT timestamp, zone_id, plant_id, COUNT(*)
       FROM plant_readings
       GROUP BY timestamp, zone_id, plant_id
       HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;
     - Observation : The dataset shows duplicate entries for each unique combination of timestamp, zone_id, and plant_id, as indicated by a consistent count of 2 for all rows. This suggests a potential data redundancy 
       issue, likely due to missing constraints or errors in the data insertion process, requiring further investigation and cleanup.
   - Query Efficiency for Analytics :
     - Why Relevant?
       - The project involves querying the database for time-series data and zone/plant-specific data. Ensuring these queries are efficient is critical for the REST API and analytics endpoints.
     - Query for Efficiency check:
       ```bash
       EXPLAIN ANALYZE SELECT AVG(temperature), AVG(humidity)
       FROM plant_readings
       WHERE zone_id = 'zone_1' AND timestamp BETWEEN '2024-01-01' AND '2024-02-01';
     - Observation: The execution time is relatively efficient at 48.91 ms, but the sequential scan suggests potential for optimization, such as creating an index on zone_id and timestamp, to improve performance for 
       similar queries in the future.

### ü¶æ Structural Improvements
  1. **Add Indexing:** - Optimize query performance for frequently queried columns.
     - **Query for Indexing:**
       ```bash
       CREATE INDEX idx_zone_timestamp ON plant_readings (zone_id, timestamp);
     - **Outcome:**
        1. Improved Query Performance: Queries filtering by zone_id and timestamp will execute faster, reducing response time for API calls and other database operations.
        2. Efficient Data Access: The index allows the database to locate relevant rows quickly, avoiding costly sequential scans on the plant_readings table.

## üìù Task 2: REST API

### üìë Setup for REST API creation

**Run the Application**:
   Start the FastAPI server by running the following command in your project directory:

   ```bash
   uvicorn api.main:app --reload
   ```

   Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to: **http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs**.
   Use the Swagger UI to test the endpoints.

### üîí Authentication and Security

### JWT Authentication
The project implements **JWT (JSON Web Token)** authentication to secure endpoints and ensure authorized access. The `fastapi-jwt-auth` library is used to handle token creation, validation, and authorization processes. A secret key is set for signing tokens, and an access token is generated during login.

### Secured Endpoints
- All API endpoints, except the `/health-check`, are secured using JWT authentication.
- The `Authorize.jwt_required()` dependency ensures that only requests with valid tokens are allowed access.
- Users must log in via the `/login` endpoint with valid credentials (`admin` and `password` as defaults) to obtain a JWT access token.

### Default Login Credentials for Swagger UI
- Username: admin
- Password: password

### Health Check
The `/health-check` endpoint is publicly accessible and does not require authentication. It is used to verify that the system is operational.

### How It Works:
1. The user provides login credentials to the `/login` endpoint, which returns a JWT access token upon successful authentication.
2. The access token is included in the `Authorization` header (`Bearer <token>`) for all subsequent API requests.
3. Unauthorized requests without a valid token are rejected with a 401 status code.

This setup ensures that the system is both secure and user-friendly, while allowing health monitoring without authentication.
